# Phoenix Scaffold
This is a simple web application built using [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.github.io/) + [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/). Also it uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database and everything is in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). For continuous integration and continuous deployment I used [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
